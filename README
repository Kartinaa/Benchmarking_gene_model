# 3D Structure-based Generative Small Molecule Drug Design: Are We There Yet?
This is a benchmarking study for current 3D structure-based generative models, focusing on the chemical plausibility of generated structures. Novel metrics were proposed to facilitate the development of this area.


## Dependencies
### Conda environment:
A conda environment file is provided to install the conda environment.
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate cheminfo
```
### Package requirement
The versions of key packages used in this study are shown as following:
Package  | Version
--- | ---
Python | 3.11.9
rdkit | 2023.9.6
useful-rdkit-utils | 0.56

### Data availability
All the datasets used in metrics are provided, the ring system frequency of ZINC20 and ZINC22 drug-like molecules are under `data` folder. The BM scaffold files extracted from ZINC20 and ZINC22 drug-like molecules
could be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k4UIMPTKbDZhaEMlUwq6kTffof7UoTM7?usp=sharing).


## Structure of the repo
### Molecules generated by each algorithm
The molecules generated by each algorithm are saved in folders named after the respective algorithms. 
All metrics and known medicinal chemistry filters are applied to each set of molecules in the `Ring_system.ipynb` file located within each folder.

### Figure generation
All figures presented in the manuscript were generated using the `Picture_drawing.ipynb` file.
